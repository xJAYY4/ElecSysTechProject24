Environmental Monitoring System

**********Overview**********

This project involves the development of an environmental monitoring system that collects data from various sensors, processes the data, and presents predictions through a dashboard. 
The system utilizes an Arduino (and Raspberry Pi) to interface with sensors, logs data in CSV format, uploads it to Google Drive, and employs predictive modeling techniques for analysis and visualization.

**********Workflow Overview**********
1. Sensor Data Collection:
The system uses an Arduino (and Raspberry Pi) to read data from environmental sensors, such as the DHT11 (temperature and humidity) and MQ135 (air quality).
Sensors must be configured correctly to ensure accurate readings of environmental parameters.

2. Data Logging:
Collected sensor data is logged into a CSV file on the Raspberry Pi.
Readings are periodically written to the CSV format, including timestamps to track when each reading was taken.

3. Upload to Google Drive:
The Google Drive API or a simple file upload script is used to transfer the CSV file from the Raspberry Pi to a Google Drive account.
This process can be automated using scheduled scripts (e.g., cron jobs on Linux) or performed manually.

4. Data Preprocessing:
The CSV file is accessed from Google Drive for analysis.
Python libraries like Pandas are utilized to read the CSV and preprocess the data, including cleaning and feature engineering.
Data preparation involves selecting relevant features and handling missing values for modeling.

5. Model Development:
A predictive model is chosen and trained based on the collected data. Depending on project goals, this may involve regression or classification techniques.
Libraries such as Scikit-learn or TensorFlow are employed to create and evaluate the model.

6. Visualization and Dashboard Creation:
Predictions are visualized using graphs and dashboards after model training.
Tools like Streamlit, Dash, or Plotly are used to create interactive dashboards that display real-time data and predictions.

7. Monitoring and Iteration:
New data is continuously collected, and the model is updated periodically to improve accuracy.
The dashboard is adjusted to reflect new insights or changes in the model's performance.
